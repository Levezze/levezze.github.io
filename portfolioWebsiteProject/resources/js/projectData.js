                    This project was a Codecademy coding assignment focused on building a homepage for an imaginary club. 
                    The goal was to design a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes using CSS features like 
                    <strong>Flexbox</strong> and <strong>Grid</strong>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I chose to create a homepage for a fictional photography club based in Williamsburg. The design includes an embedded 
                    <strong>Google map</strong> to showcase the club's location and a small <strong>image gallery</strong> that highlights sample 
                    photography work, adding visual interest and functionality to the page.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with responsive design principles and learned how to structure HTML and CSS 
                    for flexibility, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
