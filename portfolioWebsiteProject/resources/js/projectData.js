      <p>
        This project was a Codecademy coding assignment focused on building a homepage for an imaginary club. 
        The goal was to design a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes using 
        CSS features like 
        <strong>Flexbox</strong> and <strong>Grid</strong>.
        <br><br>
        I chose to create a homepage for a fictional photography club based in Williamsburg. The design includes an 
        embedded <strong>Google map</strong> to showcase the club's location and a small <strong>image gallery</strong>
        that highlights sample photography work, adding visual interest and functionality to the page.
        <br><br>
        Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with responsive design principles and learned 
        how to structure HTML and CSS for flexibility, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile, tablet, 
        and desktop devices.

    <p>
      In this Codecademy project, I honed my skills in <strong>CSS styling</strong> and <strong>Flexbox layout
      techniques</strong> by creating a responsive satirical webpage inspired by <em>God Emperor of Dune</em>, 
      the fourth book in Frank Herbert's <em>Dune</em> series.
      <br><br>
      The project required exclusive use of Flexbox to structure the page, 
      which allowed for flexible and dynamic layouts across different screen sizes.
      <br><br>
      The website, designed as a fictional corporate page, playfully imagines a company tied to the unique themes 
      and characters of <em>God Emperor of Dune</em>, 
      blending humor with sci-fi lore. 
      <br><br>
      This exercise helped reinforce my understanding of responsive design principles and CSS structuring for 
      web development.

    "title": "Random Coding Tip Generator",
    "text": `
    <p>
      In this Codecademy Portfolio Project, I created a JavaScript-based message generator that provides random 
      coding tips in three categories: <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. 
      <br><br>
      Each category includes five subjects, with each subject offering five unique tips. 
      The program delivers a fresh, randomized coding tip every time it runs, providing a helpful and interactive 
      learning experience.
      <br><br>
      Additionally, I incorporated the JavaScript functionality directly into a webpage, allowing users to access the 
      generator in a browser environment with a user-friendly interface.
      <br><br>
      This project reinforced skills in JavaScript, Git version control, and command-line usage, 
      as well as integrating JavaScript into web development.

    "title": "Python To-Do List",
    "text": `
    <p>
      While learning Python, I developed a simple to-do list app using the <strong>Streamlit</strong> 
      library to create a clean, interactive user interface. The app allows users to efficiently manage tasks 
      by adding new items, marking tasks as complete, and deleting them as needed. 
      <br><br>
      This project provided practical experience in Python programming and using Streamlit to build functional, 
      user-friendly applications.

    <p>
      Completed the MIT Professional Education Applied Data Science Program with a capstone project on 
      <strong>Facial Emotion Detection</strong>. 
      <br><br>
      The project involved developing a Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) AI model using a Convolutional Neural 
      Network (CNN) to classify four emotions: Angry, happy, sad, and surprised. The model was trained on a 
      black-and-white dataset with strong performance, and next steps include expanding the dataset and 
      fine-tuning the model for broader application.
